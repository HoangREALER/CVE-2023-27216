var _wan_virtual_desc="The <em>"+top.deviceName+"</em> externally acts as server. It receives the requests of remote users under its public IP address and forwards them automatically to the Virtual Server. So a client in your network behind NAT or firewall can provide services as a Virtual Server. You just have to enable specific ports or port ranges and protocols (UDP/TCP). File sharing or web services for e.g. HTTP, FTP or POP3 are possible. The private IP addresses of the servers in the local network remain safe. If you have a dynamic IP address, you may want to enable DynDNS additionally.";
